## About The Project ðŸš€
A lot of people who are passionate about tech or are just getting started with tech don't have the necessary channels to access these events. That's where <strong>hive</strong> come in. With hive, community events with active members are able to add their events via the <strong>Buzzy</strong> Discord Bot.

## How it Works ðŸ”§

Basically users are able to contribute events into the hive website by interacting with the discord bot.

If the bot detects a valid link (either meetup.com/lu.ma), it will send the URL to a deployed Web Scraper and once the data is extracted from the event page, it will be parsed into the website and injected into MongoDB.
